# Briefing 3.0

This new major release brings the code base up to the current state of the art and sets the course for further features.

## Vue3 and Typescript

A modernization of the code now brings [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) support and the complete migration to [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Typescript security improves the reliability of the source code.

## Localization

The standard library [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) is now used for translations, opening the doors for better support of appropriate tools. So far Briefing is available in 13 languages, if you are interested, here is a [manual for extension](../locales/README.md).

## Other

- Docker images have been updated to node 18.
- Revision of the documentation
- QRCode fullscreen by click

## Outlook

The base of Briefing is solid. The next steps will be to expand frequently requested functionalities.

**The code is available as open source as before at <https://github.com/holtwick/briefing/> and the app for free use at <https://brie.fi/ng>.**
